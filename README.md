# quarkus-github-action
I created a GitHub Action file that checks out, packages, builds, and pushes a Docker container.  I accidentally gave it the same name as a Quarkiverse plugin that builds GitHub Actions with Quarkus so I moved it to this repo: https://github.com/jeremyrdavis/a-github-action-for-quarkus
